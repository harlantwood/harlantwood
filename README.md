I'm a lifelong coder, decentralized systems architect, and AI engineer. Currently, I'm the CTO at **CoreNexus**, a visionary 3D Social Operating System with regenerative impact capabilities, and the architect of **TrustGraph**, an open source reputation interchange format designed to foster decentralized trust networks. My work balances open systems, decentralized tech, and AI Engineering, and I'm passionate about reimagining technology to empower autonomy, privacy, and collaboration.

### ðŸŒŒ Open Source Contributions & Passion Projects

#### **[TrustGraph](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph)**
TrustGraph is an open source passion project, built as an interoperable format for decentralized reputation information. Designed to enable self-sovereign identity and selective sharing, TrustGraph sets the foundation for systems like peer-to-peer credit ratings, academic review and establishing trust in global networks.  The most active repo is currently the [TrustGraph Holochain library](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph-holochain).

#### **[Smallest Federated Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/pull/204)**
Many years ago, I worked with Ward Cunningham on Smallest Federated Wiki, and added a couchdb backend in <https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/pull/204>.

### ðŸ“š Featured Projects

#### **CoreNexus** - [CoreNexus.is](https://CoreNexus.is)
CoreNexus is a **3D Social Operating System and Regenerative Impact Dashboard**, uniting decentralized social and commerce functions with gamified, purpose-oriented philanthropy. It's a memory palace for self-sovereign data, and a regenerative economy engine, bringing Web3 interoperability across reputation, SSO, and semantic data layers.

#### **Mirror Astrology** - [aistrologer.app](https://aistrologer.app)
An AI-powered astrology platform blending AI, Rails, and OpenAI APIs to deliver poetic, deeply personalized astrological insights. I implemented a flexible model-switching interface, enabling seamless experimentation with cutting-edge LLMs, including Stable Diffusion and OpenLLaMA.

#### **HoloFractal** - [HoloFractal.is](https://HoloFractal.is)
Proof of concept for Holochain NFTs, exploring decentralized and self-sovereign data ownership. This project integrates concepts from distributed identity and Web3, with a focus on reputation systems and semantic interoperability.

#### **NodeSphere** - [NodeSphere](https://github.com/harlantwood/NodeSphere)
A decentralized collaboration platform, **NodeSphere** prototypes secure workplace attestations with Ethereum and IPFS. This project demonstrates my long-term vision of transparent, blockchain-powered systems in reputation and governance.

### ðŸ”­ My Mission

I'm here to architect **Enlightened Structures**: distributed systems that inflect civilization toward cooperative abundance. I believe technology should empower every individual with control over their data, reputation, and creativity. I am committed to helping prevent a dystopian future of AI-driven inequality, advocating for inclusivity across human, AI, and autonomous entities.
