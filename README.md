### 🌠 About Me

I’m Harlan—a lifelong coder, decentralized systems architect, and AI engineer. Currently, I’m the CTO at **CoreNexus**, a visionary 3D Social Operating System with regenerative impact capabilities, and the architect of **TrustGraph**, an open-source reputation interchange format designed to foster decentralized trust networks. My work balances open systems, decentralized tech, and AI-driven insights, and I’m passionate about reimagining technology to empower autonomy, privacy, and collaboration.

> "I’m here to catalyze luminous tools that free and uplift humanity, avoiding scarcity, enabling creativity, and championing new-age abundance."

### 🌌 Open-Source Contributions & Passion Projects

#### **[TrustGraph](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph)**
TrustGraph is my open-source passion project, built as an interoperable format for decentralized reputation information. Designed to enable self-sovereign identity and selective sharing, TrustGraph sets the foundation for systems like peer-to-peer credit ratings, academic review, and more—focusing on lifting up underbanked communities and establishing trust in global networks.

#### **[Smallest Federated Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/pull/204)**
In one of my favorite open-source contributions, I worked with Ward Cunningham’s Smallest Federated Wiki, submitting a significant [pull request](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/pull/204) that improved core functionality and stability for the community-driven platform.

### 📚 Featured Projects

#### **CoreNexus** - [CoreNexus.is](https://CoreNexus.is)
CoreNexus is a **3D Social Operating System and Regenerative Impact Dashboard**, uniting decentralized social and commerce functions with gamified, purpose-oriented philanthropy. It’s a memory palace for self-sovereign data, and a regenerative economy engine, bringing Web3 interoperability across reputation, SSO, and semantic data layers.

#### **Mirror Astrology** - [aistrologer.app](https://aistrologer.app)
An AI-powered astrology platform blending AI, Rails, and OpenAI APIs to deliver poetic, deeply personalized astrological insights. I implemented a flexible model-switching interface, enabling seamless experimentation with cutting-edge LLMs, including Stable Diffusion and OpenLLaMA.

#### **HoloFractal** - [HoloFractal.is](https://HoloFractal.is)
Proof of concept for Holochain NFTs, exploring decentralized and self-sovereign data ownership. This project integrates concepts from distributed identity and Web3, with a focus on reputation systems and semantic interoperability.

#### **NodeSphere** - [NodeSphere](https://github.com/harlantwood/NodeSphere)
A decentralized collaboration platform, **NodeSphere** prototypes secure workplace attestations with Ethereum and IPFS. This project demonstrates my long-term vision of transparent, blockchain-powered systems in reputation and governance.

### 🔭 My Mission

I'm here to architect **Enlightened Structures**: distributed systems that inflect civilization toward cooperative abundance. I believe technology should empower every individual with control over their data, reputation, and creativity. I am committed to helping prevent a dystopian future of AI-driven inequality, advocating for inclusivity across human, AI, and autonomous entities.
